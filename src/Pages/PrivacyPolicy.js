    HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?
  </h2>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    <strong>In Short:</strong> If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.

    HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?
  </h2>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    <strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

  <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">
    HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?
  </h2>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    <strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical security measures.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

    <strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records.

    Withdrawing Your Consent
  </h3>
  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#contact-us" className="text-blue-500 hover:underline">'HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' </a> below.

    CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES
  </h2>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a <strong>Do-Not-Track</strong> ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing DNT signals has been finalised. 
  </p>

  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
    As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
